<p></p>
I'm a 16-year-old lovely guy studying in HKUST!
<p></p>
This website mainly holds my notes of all the lectures I 've taken!
<p></p>
Besides, I may share some blogs and FAQ occasionally for fun~~~

## Education 

This dumb guy somehow hated the dull exams in eighth grade, so he taught himself six AP subjects by devouring the textbooksâ€¦
<p></p>
Then, he enrolled into HKUST by means of HKDSE...... Really complicated.

## Hobbies?
Singing?
<p></p>
Watching football sometimes?
<p></p>
Sports?
<p></p>
Erhu? Piano?


## Relationship?
find me at 51614059. 
<p></p>
I nearly do everything alone at school.

## Planning!
### OK,that's a lot!
I'm going to do game theory, Advanced Mathematical Finance, Life Contingencies Models, Insurance Risk and Derivative Securities at HKUST
Besides, I'll audit the algorithm course offered in HKUST this semester...<p></p>
I will also study Basic machine learning and stat knowlege for my interest. 

As for the summer vacation, I'll only do algorithm and have fun~~~ <p></p>
May kindly send emails to Prof.Hur/DON NOH/WANG XIAOLIANG/TIAN DI/YAN JI/ZHU YIDONG FOR RESEARCH PUREPOSES...If so, do algorithm at the 3rd sem

For the third semester, I'm going to do many common courses and attendence-required courses. <p></p>
Since I WANT TO do self-studing the following stuff: MIT6.031 -> cmu 15.213 -> UCB CS61C -> cs.6S081 -> CMU 15.445  and Maybe some introductory coursera courses! 
<p></p>
Besides, doing UROP with Profs will be also considered!

As for the coming winter, I'm going to do my first internship! Maybe SWE/QUANT/IBANK(IBD?)/ ......

Then, for the 4th semester, I may do full-time research/internship. I decided to use the two days for my school studying~<p></p>
The same are for the summer, and my 5th sem! After that, I'll be free with no course!!!<p></p>
But noted that the oral English, the algorithm and the brain teaser are of vital importance of finding jobs.
So make sure do many practises during my idle(?) time!!!

Let's calculate that the time I "graduate" is at my age of 18!!!
